## About the job

### About Us

We're building the operating system that scales eCommerce operations — starting with Amazon sellers today. We offer outcomes as a service: not tools, not dashboards, but real results for sellers. We have 20+ clients (with a sales engine in place to add 30 clients per month) with an early stage eCommerce data platform. We're bootstrapped, and we're evolving the tech platform that takes us to 1,000+.

**The Vision:**  
AI agents that augment human expertise in e-commerce - handling data analysis, pattern recognition, and repetitive optimization while humans focus on strategy, relationships, and creative decisions.

**The Market Need:**  
Agencies are drowning in operational work. Brands can't afford $5k/month retainers. There's a massive gap between enterprise solutions and what growing sellers actually need.

## About the Role & Your Mission

### End-to-End Responsibility

- Own the 0→1 journey of our tech platform. You'll scope features with the ops team and clients, build them, and ship to production. Ideation to deployment — it's yours.
- You're not just writing code, you're shaping the company. You'll make critical technical decisions on products that 20+ clients (and growing) depend on daily.

### Shape our Technical Future

- The platform you build will scale us from 20 clients to 1,000+. You'll architect systems that need to hold up at that scale.
- Work across the entire stack — frontend, backend, infra. No silos.

### Cross Functional Collaboration

- Work directly with founders on product strategy and technical roadmap
- Help define engineering culture and practices as we grow the team
- Sit in on client calls to understand problems firsthand

## Our Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, ShadCN, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery (integrating an analytics DB now)

That said, we care less about whether you've used these exact tools and more about:

- **Strong fundamentals:** you understand how systems work, not just how frameworks work
- **First-principles thinking:** you can architect solutions, not just implement tutorials
- **AI-native mindset:** You see LLMs as a multiplier for how you build, not a novelty to experiment with on weekends

If you can learn fast and think clearly about systems, the specific tech is secondary.

## Our Culture

**100% Remote:**  
Work from anywhere. We care about output, not online status.

**Ownership Over Everything:**  
You own outcomes, not tasks. No one will tell you what to do every day. You figure out what matters and make it happen.

**Bootstrapped by Choice:**  
No VC pressure, no vanity metrics. We prioritize revenue and sustainable growth. This means we're scrappy, intentional, and building something that lasts, not something that looks good in a pitch deck. What you get instead is equity that means something, decisions that aren't dictated by investors, and a seat at the table when it matters.

**Growth as a Team Sport:**  
We push ourselves to grow. In skill, in thinking, in who we're becoming. Work and otherwise. You'll grow faster here than anywhere else, but you have to want it and sign up for the self work involved.

**Comfort with Ambiguity:**  
We're a startup. Things change. You'll need to move ideas forward without perfect information or hand-holding.

## You'll Thrive Here If…

- At Equal Collective you won't get stuck maintaining an obscure microservice or working in the shadows of the product org.
- You get to own the entire service end-to-end — no committees, no waiting on PMs, no "that's not my job"
- You get energy from shipping fast and iterating based on real user feedback
- You're comfortable context-switching: backend one day, customer call the next, infra debugging the day after
- You want to talk directly to customers to understand problems firsthand
- You care more about impact than titles, process, or looking busy
- You see AI as a multiplier for how you build, not a threat to your job

## The Role is not for you If…

- You expect detailed specs before you start building — here, you write the specs
- You need the full picture before making decisions — we're always discovering
- You want others to handle the "dirty work" — there's no one else
- You're looking for a predictable 9-5 with clear boundaries
- You prefer deep specialization over wearing multiple hats
- You're uncomfortable with ambiguity, changing priorities, or figuring things out as you go

## Where this leads

In 2-3 years, this role evolves into CTO, Head of Product Engineering, founding engineer at your own startup, or technical co-founder of something we spin out together.

You'll leave with the reps most engineers never get: building from zero, talking to users, shipping under pressure, and making architecture bets that actually matter. We're building engineers who can become founders.
