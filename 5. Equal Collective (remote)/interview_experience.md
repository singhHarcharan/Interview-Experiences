# Interview Experience - Equal Collective

## Round 1: Founder's Screening Round - January 13, 2026

### Interview Details
- **Duration**: Scheduled for 30 minutes, but ended in 10 minutes
- **Interviewer**: Co-founder
- **Style**: Direct and to-the-point

### Interview Flow
The interview began abruptly without the usual introductions or small talk. The co-founder immediately posed a challenging question:

> "Since you graduated in 2024 and did development during college, you've seen the era before AI. What has changed in software development? Give me a 5-minute masterclass based on your experience. In what ways has AI changed how we build software?"

### Outcome
I provided a vague response, which didn't seem to satisfy the interviewer. The call concluded within 10 minutes with the co-founder stating they would decide on further interviews based on this interaction.
