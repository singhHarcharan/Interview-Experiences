CTC: 4L-5L

Round 1:
You have 15 minutes to build an app with a single POST /process endpoint, implementing per-user rate-limiting (5 calls/min), 
result caching, and a simulated 1 sec async ‘processing’ (just reverse the text). Return JSON with the reversed text, a cache-hit 
flag, and how many calls remain. Use Redis (via REDIS_URL).

Verdict: Ghosted
