# Interview Experiences Repository

Welcome to my Interview Experiences repository! This repository contains detailed accounts of my technical interview processes with various companies. Each subdirectory is dedicated to a specific company and includes relevant materials such as problem statements, code solutions, and interview questions.

## 📝 How to Navigate

1. Each company's interview experience is stored in its own directory, prefixed with a number for ordering.
2. The directory name follows the format: `[Number].[CompanyName]([WorkLocation])`
   - Example: `1.DotNitron_Technologies(remote)`
3. Common files you'll find in each company's directory:
   - `ProblemStatement.txt` - The coding challenge or problem given during the interview
   - `solution.[ext]` - My solution to the problem
   - `interview_notes.md` - Detailed notes about the interview process
   - `job_description.txt` - The job description for the position
