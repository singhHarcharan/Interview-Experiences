Round 2: 
DSA Discussion (40 min) - (Jan. 6, 2026)

This round had two parts. In the first part, he tested my teaching skills as the profile was for a DSA Mentor position.
He asked me to choose a DSA topic (I chose Linked List) and summarize it within 10-15 minutes.

In the second part, he tested my DSA skills:
- Asked about the total number of questions I've solved on different platforms, my ratings, and contest participation
- Gave me LeetCode's "Sort Colors" problem to solve within 20 minutes
  - Question Link: [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)
  - I solved it using the Three Pointer Approach with O(1) space and O(n) time complexity
  - Performed a dry run and code review
  - He was quite impressed with the interview

Within 5-10 minutes, I received a message from the recruiter that I had cleared this round, and she asked for my CTC expectations.
