The Mission

We are building the next generation of Autonomous AI Testing Agents. This isn’t just about writing test scripts; it’s about building intelligent, agentic workflows that can navigate mobile apps, understand UI context, and self-heal. We are looking for a backend powerhouse who thrives in the "zero-to-one" phase of a startup and is ready to work at a relentless pace to redefine the QA landscape.

The Role

As an early Backend Engineer, you will be responsible for building the core infrastructure that powers our AI agents. You will design high-concurrency systems in Golang or Python that interface with LLMs and mobile environments.

Key Responsibilities:

Agentic Orchestration: Develop and optimize backend services for AI agentic workflows (planning, execution, and feedback loops).
Infrastructure: Build robust APIs and microservices that can handle real-time data from mobile device clusters.
Mobile Integration: Work closely with mobile internals (Android/Appium) to allow AI agents to "see" and "interact" with apps like a human would.
Scaling: Architect low-latency systems to manage high-volume concurrent agent tasks.
**What We’re Looking For

Technical DNA:**
Core Stack: 2+ years of professional experience in Golang or Python. You should be comfortable with high-performance concurrency and asynchronous programming.

AI/Agentic Interest: Prior exposure to LLM frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI) or building autonomous workflows.

Problem Solving: A "builder" mindset. You don't wait for a spec; you find a way to make it work.

2. The "Start-up" Edge:

High Hustle: You thrive in ambiguity and move faster than the average engineer.
Startup Pedigree: Preference for candidates from early-stage, fast-paced product startups.

**3. Added Advantages (The Cherry on Top):

Deep knowledge of Appium or Android Internals (ADB, UI Automator, View Hierarchy).
Experience with containerization (Docker/K8s) and cloud-native deployments.
Why Join Us?

Direct Impact: You aren't a cog in a machine; you are building the machine itself.
Cutting Edge: Work at the intersection of Generative AI and Mobile Automation.
Growth: Rapid career progression as we scale the core engineering team.
