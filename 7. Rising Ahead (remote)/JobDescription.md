## About Us

We are building Athena, a next-generation decision intelligence platform designed to help enterprises replace manual, fragmented decision-making with auditable, outcome-driven automation. Our work sits at the intersection of data, analytics, and software, focused 
on solving real business problems rather than building dashboards or experiments.

We operate as a small, highly accountable team, prioritizing clarity, execution, and product quality. This role offers the opportunity 
to work hands-on on a production-grade platform, learn directly from senior leaders, and contribute meaningfully to a system used by 
real clients.

## Role Overview

We're looking for a Full Stack Engineer to join us on a 3-month contract as a mutual evaluation period, with a clear path to full-time 
employment for high performers. This role is for someone early in their career who wants hands-on exposure to building a real, 
production-grade platform and growing into a long-term engineering role.

You'll work directly on Athena, our decision intelligence platform, contributing across frontend, backend, and data workflows.

## What You'll Do

- Build and ship full-stack features across frontend and backend
- Develop and integrate APIs, services, and UI components
- Work with structured data models and business logic
- Debug, test, and improve reliability and performance
- Collaborate closely with product and architecture leads
- Write clean, maintainable code and basic technical documentation

## What We're Looking For

- 1–2 years of hands-on experience as a Full Stack or Software Engineer
- Experience with:
  - A modern frontend framework (React preferred)
  - Backend development (Python or Node.js preferred)
  - REST APIs and SQL databases
  - Git and collaborative development workflows
- Ability to work independently with guidance
- Strong ownership mindset and willingness to learn fast

## Nice to Have

- Exposure to data, analytics, or dashboard-driven applications
- Familiarity with cloud platforms (Azure / AWS / GCP)
- Experience with Docker or basic DevOps concepts
- Interest in enterprise or B2B software

## Why This Role?

- Short-term contract designed as a trial for long-term fit
- Real ownership and meaningful product work from day one
- Close collaboration with senior leadership and product owners
- Opportunity to convert to a full-time role within or after 3 months, based on performance and business needs
